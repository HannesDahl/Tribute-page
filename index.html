        <h3>About</h3>

        <p>Elon Reeve Musk FRS (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He holds South African,
            Canadian, and U.S. citizenship and is the founder, CEO, and lead designer of SpaceX; co-founder, CEO, and
            product architect of Tesla, Inc.; co-founder and CEO of Neuralink; and co-founder of PayPal. In December
            2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Born and raised in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University.
            He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received an economics degree
            from the Wharton School and a degree in physics from the College of Arts and Sciences. He began a Ph.D. in
            applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University in 1995 but dropped out after two days to
            pursue an entrepreneurial career. He subsequently co-founded Zip2, a web software company, which was
            acquired by Compaq for $340 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with
            Confinity in 2000 and later that year became PayPal, which was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October
            2002.
